# boxes

A program that takes a CSV file giving the dimensions and relative positions of rooms, and outputs an OpenSCAD file showing the building.

Rooms can be placed relative to other rooms (left, right, behind, front) in one dimension, and which edge lines up with the room they're relative to to locate them in the other dimension.

Later versions should include doors and windows, and allow things (boxes, cupboards etc) to be placed inside the rooms, using transparency to make the nesting visible.
