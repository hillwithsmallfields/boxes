# Dimensions file for Cambridge Makespace

The dimensions are in centimetres, and the coordinate system has
`width` running along the main corridor.

It's not an exact model, as this system works only with cuboids, and
at least the front and back walls of the main space are not actually
parallel.

I have good intentions of adding shelving and storage boxes to the
model, and perhaps furniture, so it can be used for experimenting with
possible layout alterations.
